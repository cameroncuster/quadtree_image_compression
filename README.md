# Quadtree Image Compression
- compresses images with a Quadtree structure
- developed with an eye for abstraction, TDD, and object-oriented programming
- can be used to so videos can be attached and compressed and emailed to me from
my website
- the Quadtree can be used out-of-the-box and included as a library


### Note
[Similar package for NPM (NodeJS)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quadtree-lib)

- I later found this package, but wanted a package which was entirely
customizable for my applications.
